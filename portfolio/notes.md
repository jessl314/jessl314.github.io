Postman:

we can either use:

1. localhost endpoint: https://localhost:5000/api/auth/register

2. render endpoint: https://jesslpersonalwebsite.onrender.com/api/auth/register 

- making sure to add a Header with key: Content-Type and value: application/json

-- for register, our body is:

{
  "username": "test",
  "password": "1234"
}

which can be used to register me as a user whenever I want (don't want to have a register feature on UI...)

my credentials lol

{
  "username": "jessica",
  "password": "mypasswordforwebsite"
}


next steps:

1. figure out how to get bare bones dashboard out and like a login button on the portfolio website
2. use cursor to check for errors
3. begin the UI for navbar and start the other pages for admin portal
