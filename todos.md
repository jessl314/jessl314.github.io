TODO: implement JWT + add a UI in the server backend for login and basic structure such as side navbar for other pages

- check what else I need to do and start making the UI

NEXT STEPS:

1.  figure out the UI and how to successfully CRUD information in the backend
2.  figure out how to fetch data from my database and display it somehow (don't care about UI) on the frontend
3.  display the information properly on my portfolio website
4. make it extra pretty with some sprites or something from itch.io
